				<h2>Our Website</h2>
				<p>The First Step is an E-Book Website which provides E-Books for the college students. We have started this for the 1st and 2nd year students of four renowed colleges namely SGSITS , IET - DAVV , Medicaps Indore and BIT, Durg. Not only this, we provide you with some fascinating novels. As you know, Engineers are book lovers. Moreover, novels are considered a good source of entertainment and we've tried to put all the novels of the best sellers on this website.</p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>The First Step is started as an alternative to books. Our website contains many E-Books which will surely save you time that you waste while finding those on the internet. Currently we have E-books for 1st year only but definitely, in the coming months our mission is to provide the E-Books for all the year. Moreover, we will not limit ourselves to two colleges only. As the time progresses, our motto is to cover all the colleges of Indore.</p>
